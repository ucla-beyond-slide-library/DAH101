free datasets - which will turn readers into proficient OpenRefine users
in the fastest possible way. (To get to the book, click on “EBSCO
eBooks.”)

“Cleaning Up Your Excel 2013 Data”: I like OpenRefine, but if you
prefer, you can use Excel to do some data-cleaning. Lynda offers several

viewed in Excel and prepped for geocoding.

[Designing Databases for Historical Research, by Mark
Merry](http://www.history.ac.uk/research-training/courses/designing-databases):
Read this before you try to design a database for your research. The

is an excellent primer for the beginner.

*For Content Management Systems*

[Creating a blog post in
WordPress](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/creating-a-blog-post-on-our-course-site/):

[Preparing for CSV
Import](https://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/CSV_Import_2.0): Have organized
data you want to import? Omeka has instructions on how to import a CSV
file.

[Managing Item Types in
Omeka](https://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Item_Types_2.0): Are your
objects unique? Item types in Omeka are user-defined type of object,
with associated metadata. While Omeka comes with predefined item types
with fields, you can easily edit these types, or add your own types.
This resource shows you how.

[Omeka’s Documentation Page](https://omeka.org/codex/Documentation): For
additional troubleshooting, Omeka offers a very thorough set of
documentation.

*For Project Management*

[*Making Things Happen*, by Scott
Berkun](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Things-Happen-Mastering-Management/dp/0596517718):
There is a lot of terrible writing on project management, and Berkun’s
book is one of the few I like. It’s designed for business professionals,
but its principles are generally applicable, and the book doesn’t insult
your intelligence.

[“Issues in Large Project Management,” by Lynne
Siemens](http://dhsi.org/content/2012Curriculum/12.ProjectPlanning.pdf)
(warning: giant PDF): Siemens’s class is legendary among DHers, and many
of us are alumni of the summer course she teaches at the Digital
Humanities Summer Institute. The course packet contains a wealth of
useful information, including sample project documentation.

[Tito Sierra’s presentations on project
management](http://www.slideshare.net/tsierra): Sierra, a director of
product management at EBSCO, has a terrific collection of presentations
on project management. They’re simple, to-the-point, and immensely
useful. See in particular [Project Management
Basics](http://www.slideshare.net/tsierra/project-management-basics) and
[The Project
One-Pager](http://www.slideshare.net/tsierra/the-projectonepager).

[DevDH: Developing Digital Humanities Projects](http://devdh.org/): This
site, the work of two experienced DH project managers, contains an
abundance of very useful lectures and presentations specific to DH
project development.

[Trello,](https://trello.com/)
[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

For Issue Tracking: [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

*Image Annotation*

[ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com/): This is a fun tool for linking
different parts of images to videos, images, webpages, or whatever you
want. It’s easy to use and especially nice for teaching.
[Example](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/500859588443111424).

[Neatline](http://neatline.org/): Designed for mapping, Neatline
(described above) can also handle image annotation.
[Example](http://bikinghistory.com/neatline/show/bf-goodrich-studio-components).

[Gigapixel](http://storymap.knightlab.com/gigapixel.html): Much like its
sister platform, StoryMaps, GigaPixel makes it easy to take a
step-by-step tour of image annotations.
[Example](http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storymapjs/latest/embed/?url=https://www.googledrive.com/host/0B1d8oNIpMx53Wk9CdDlVZ01qU1E/published.json).

[Prezi](http://prezi.com/): Some people hate Prezi (I’ve heard people
say it gives them vertigo), but used responsibly, Prezi can be a useful,
fun tool for presentations. If PowerPoint is a film strip, Prezi is a
blank canvas. Rather than moving from slide to slide, you can hop around
a canvas, zooming in or panning out as the mood strikes. And you can
embed Prezis anywhere, making them quite useful for sharing information.
[Example](http://prezi.com/piwbxuqaih4f/world-cup-2014-must-watch-players-uk/).

*Exhibit Platforms*

*If you have a collection of sources, you might want a way to show them
off. Here are a couple of platforms designed specifically for organizing
collections and arranging them into stories.*

[Omeka](http://omeka.org/): You can use Omeka to create collections and
exhibits of [stamps](http://blacksonstamp.omeka.net/), [artifacts
related to a historical
event](http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/atomic),
or [artists’
books](http://marbl-omeka.library.emory.edu/marbl/exhibits/show/artistsbooksshowcase).
The real strength of Omeka is its metadata (the information you enter
about each item in your exhibit). It uses a standard called Dublin Core
that makes collections compatible with one other. It has a lot of cool
plugins so that you can do things like allow people to [contribute items
to your archive](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/Contribution). You
should be aware that there are two “kinds” of Omeka:
[omeka.org](http://omeka.org/), which you install on your own server;
and [omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net/), which is hosted for you. Some
people like the former because you can customize it more heavily, but
omeka.net is perfectly fine for getting started.

[Google Open Gallery](http://www.google.com/opengallery): This is a very
new platform, so details are scarce, but it’s an exhibit platform that
appears to have some nice visual features, good search and filtering
capabilities, and a low learning curve. You have to request a login,
which takes about a week.
[Example](http://belgian-comic-strip-center.culturalspot.org/home).
