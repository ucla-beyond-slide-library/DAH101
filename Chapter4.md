4.2 Resources

[The Geospatial Historian](http://geospatialhistorian.wordpress.com/): A
sibling to The Programming Historian, The Geospatial Historian offers a
growing collection of well-edited step-by-step tutorials.

[Geocoding Your
Data](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/mapping/):
A list of several option to add latitudes and longitudes to your data.

4.3 Tutorials

[Moving Around
Geocoordinates](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/mapping/retrieve-geocoordinates-from-one-spreadsheet-and-put-them-in-another/):
Retrieve geocoordinates from one spreadsheet and put them in another

[Google Fusion
Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232): A great
starting point for creating data visualizations, especially for simpler
charts, like pie charts and bar charts. You can’t do a ton of
customization, but you can produce results with just a few clicks.
[Here’s a basic
tutorial.](http://miriamposner.com/blog/google-fusion-table-basics-with-ius-cushman-collection/)

[“Journey to the open data jungle with OpenRefine, CartoDB, Leaflet and
Javascript,” Opensas
Blog](https://opensas.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/journey-to-the-open-data-jungle-with-openrefine-cartodb-leaflet-and-javascript/):
A tutorial that illustrates how to go from raw, messy data to
spreadsheet to map and finally to web service.

4.4 Tools

[Google Fusion
Tables:](https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories) An
experimental data visualization web application to gather, visualize,
and share data tables.

[Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/): Google's Geo products have
long been identified as a powerful learning toolkit to empower people to
visualize, share, and communicate information about the world around
them. Google Earth Pro, which is now free, extends the power of Google
Earth with additional capabilities. Features include: GIS data import,
Movie Maker, High-resolution printing, Area and 3D measurement tools,
Elevation viewsheds, and more.

[Mapline](https://mapline.com/category/blog/): Sure, you can buy an
expensive business intelligence mapping software that requires a Ph.D to
use. Or you can use Mapline to [create a map from Excel spreadsheet
data](https://mapline.com/create-a-map-from-excel-spreadsheet-data/) in
seconds. There are also a number of data sets that are offered through
the tool, if you do not already have one but want to check out the
available features.

[Palladio: A web-based platform for the visualization of complex,
multi-dimensional data. As with ManyEyes,an older IBM data viz tool, you
can upload a dataset and visualize it in a number of different ways. But
the kinds of visualizations you can do are somewhat more advanced: you
can combine maps and timelines, filter your data, make bimodal network
graphs (ManyEyes only lets you do 1-mode), create relationships among
tables, and download your data model. This may be the tool to try if you
find that ManyEyes can’t quite handle what you want. Palladio is still
new, so the documentation isn’t as robust as one might like,
but](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/) [this intro
video](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/lab-notebook/palladio/2014/06/20/full-video-tutorial/)
[is very helpful.](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/)
[Example](http://ricedh.github.io/01-palladio.html)[.](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/)

[Neatline](http://neatline.org/): Designed to work with the exhibit
platform Omeka (see below), Neatline is best for smaller mapping
projects for which visual detail and the element of time is important.
You can draw polygons on the map and use Neatline’s timeline feature to
walk users through changes over time. (You can also use Neatline to
annotate an image.) One thing that’s distinctive about Neatline is that
every point on your map can be an item from your Omeka collection. So,
for example, if you have an Omeka collection that contains works of art,
you can automatically plot each one, metadata and all, on your Neatline
map. Neatline’s [documentation](http://docs.neatline.org/) is the best
source of information about it.
[Example](http://ibnjubayr.lib.virginia.edu/view-exhibits).

[StoryMap](http://storymap.knightlab.com/): A mapping platform that’s
designed to show how a particular event (like the [Olympic
relay](http://storymap.knightlab.com/examples/sochi-2014-olympic-torch-relay.html))
or concept has unfolded over time. An easy-to-use interface walks the
user from point to point, and each map point can be enhanced with words
and pictures. Bonus:
[Gigapixel](http://storymap.knightlab.com/gigapixel.html), also a Knight
Lab project, allows you to do the same thing, but on a picture.
[Example](http://nps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=ed4298bcae2d48cc905a3491c16ca417&webmap=ea9fad7f1d6148a8bf5afc44c3662ae0).

[Google Maps Engine](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/): Go from
spreadsheet to points on a map with this easy-to-use Google tool.
[Example](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/embed?mid=zhuiTwVccKcw.kWvH6mZ0TfQI).

[Harvard WorldMap](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/): The benefit of
WorldMap is that you can not only plot your own points; you can also
combine them with layers that display other information — for example,
population numbers or demographics. It’s a way to see how the points
you’re interested in correlate with other geographical information.
[Example](http://worldmap.harvard.edu/digitalJC/).

[Esri Story Maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/): Confusingly, this is
different from StoryMap. Story Maps are great for things like tours or
travel narratives. It’s easy to create map points that incorporate
images and text, and you can switch among many different templates. Each
point has to be plotted individually, though, so it’s not great if you
have a huge amount of data.
[Example](http://story.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/?appid=d5b2c90d8a53466f9c3efb0f25d13325).

[CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/): This is a pretty easy-to-use mapping
platform that also has some advanced features. Uploading a spreadsheet
of data is easy (CartoDB can grab latitudes and longitudes for you if
you don’t already have them), and mapping data is a matter of a few
clicks. CartoDB maps tend to look really nice, and you can custom-style
them if you know CSS. But a heads-up that CartoDB only lets you work
with 50 MB of data for free; after that, you have to pay. CartoDB’s
[documentation](http://cartodb.com/docs) is excellent.
