***(Chapter 1) Introduction/ Overview to DH and  DAH***

*The world does not need another getting-started-in-DH guide! There’s
one
[here](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244275/Guides%20and%20Introductions),
and
[here](http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide),
and
[here](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/getting-started-in-digital-humanities-by-lisa-spiro/).
The set of resources offered here are the personal favorites of our team
that we would recommend to anyone who wanted to learn a new technical
skill. *

1.2 Resources

*Every single person who’s new to DH wants to know where the master
repository of projects is. Upon learning that there isn’t really one,
every single person who is new to DH wants to build one. Resist! Effort
is currently coalescing around DHCommons (below), but the reason that
there is not a grand DH repository is that it’s extraordinarily
difficult to keep such a list current and comprehensive.*

[DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/): The closest thing DH has to a
registry of projects, DHCommons has recently been “adopted” by CenterNet
(an organization of DH centers) and is branching out to include a
journal with reviews of mid-state DH projects. Project participants
contribute their own project descriptions, and people who are interested
in working on DH projects can volunteer.

[National Endowment for the Humanities Grants
Database](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx): This is
an invaluable repository of projects funded by the National Endowment
for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities, including things like
timelines, budget narratives, and other useful pieces of information.
Restrict your search to the “Digital Humanities” division.

[Drucker’s Project
Repo](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/index.php/drucker-project-repo/):
This resource developed by Johanna Drucker sketches the history of
Digital Art History through projects. There is also a connected
presentation called “[Digital Art
History?](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DAH_2015.ppt)”
that explain the project repo in greater detail.

[Digital Art History: Nuts &
Bolts](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBacaFor_UCLA_DAH_SummerInstitute2015.pdf):
This presentation by Murtha Baca lays out some basics for doing digital
art history.

[What is
Digital\_Humanities?](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkzf5ue3efddetb/Getty_DH_AH_Institute_Presner2015.ppt?dl=0):
A presentation by Todd Presner that offers a brief introduction to
Digital Humanities.

1.3 Tutorials

*No technical expert? No problem! The following resources offer
tutorials on a wide range of tools to help you get your project done. *

[Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/): If your institution doesn’t subscribe to
this library of videos, you’ll have to pay \$25–\$37.50 a month. But it
may be worth it — this is my go-to way to learn a new skill. The list of
topics is ridiculously comprehensive, and the quality of instruction and
production is uniformly high (much better than you’ll get from YouTube
videos). Some people find watching videos tedious as compared to jumping
around in a book, but Lynda does do a nice job keying its transcripts to
videos and breaking up videos into three- to five-minute chunks.

[Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/): A popular
collection of tutorials aimed specifically at humanities scholars. That
means the skills it teaches are things you’ll actually want to do, like
scrape the web for research data and format it into tables.

[“How Did They Make
That?”](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/): A guide
to help DHers reverse-engineer digital projects to that they can
re-create them on their own. See also the
[video](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/).

[Digital Humanities Questions &
Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/): A bulletin board where
DHers new and expert stump each other with questions. It’s OK to ask
newbie questions here — it’s a very friendly group.

[LibGuides Community](http://libguides.com/community.php): The downside
of LibGuides, the reference guides your library probably uses, is that
they’re kind of weird looking and hard to navigate. The upside is that
you can search all the tutorials and reference guides (all written by
experts) at once from this site. It’s an amazing resource that not that
many people know about. Try searching, for example, for “text analysis.”

[“Some Things I Hope You Will Find Useful Even if Statistics Isn’t Your
Thing”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279236049_Some_Things_i_Hope_You_Will_Find_Useful_even_if_Statistics_Isn%27t_Your_Thing):
An article by George L. Cowgill that may convince you that statistical
analysis could benefit your project.

[Statistics for the
Humanities](http://statisticsforhumanities.net/book/): Developed by
[John Canning](http://johncanning.net/), this resources is for that find
that they need for mathematical skills for the advanced study of other
subjects, including humanities and social science subjects at school or
university or in their job

1.4 Tools

### *These tool directories are a great place to start looking if you are unsure what is available to help you complete your project. *

[Digital Research Tools (DiRT) Directory](http://dirtdirectory.org/):
This is the best and most comprehensive list of DH tools. Because it’s
well-known and supported within the DH community, it’s generally up to
date.

[DH Toychest: Digital Humanities Resources for Project Building, Alan
Liu](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244243/FrontPage):
An excellent list that includes the tools, tutorials, and resources that
Liu uses in his DH courses at UC Santa Barbara.

1.5 Projects

*While the other chapters will offer projects more specific to the
chapter topic, here is a list of Museum Digital Projects that are good
to know for anyone getting to know the field of  Digital Art History.
