title: Chapter 1: Introduction/ Overview to DH and DAH
---
*Digital Art History has a set of needs that can be more specific than what most Digital Humanities
guides offer.  In this chapter, both fields are introduced and the differences between Digital Humanities (DH) and Digital Art History (DAH) are clarified.*

1.2 Resources

*Effort is currently coalescing around DHCommons to create a master DH repository, but it is difficult to keep such a list current and comprehensive. The following links are starting points to finding more DH resources.*

[DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/): The closest thing DH has to a registry of projects, DHCommons has recently been “adopted” by CenterNet (an organization of DH centers) and is branching out to include a journal with reviews of mid-state DH projects. Project participants contribute their own project descriptions, and people who are interested in working on DH projects can volunteer.

[National Endowment for the Humanities Grants Database](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx): An invaluable repository of projects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities, including things like timelines, budget narratives, and other useful pieces of information. Restrict your search to the “Digital Humanities” division.

[Drucker’s Project Repo](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/index.php/drucker-project-repo/): This resource developed by Johanna Drucker sketches the history of Digital Art History through projects. There is also a connected presentation called “[Digital Art History?](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DAH_2015.ppt)” that explain the project repo in greater detail.

[Digital Art History: Nuts & Bolts](http://program.dh.ucla.edu/getty/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBacaFor_UCLA_DAH_SummerInstitute2015.pdf): This presentation by Murtha Baca lays out some basics for doing digital art history.

[What is Digital\_Humanities?](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkzf5ue3efddetb/Getty_DH_AH_Institute_Presner2015.ppt?dl=0): A presentation by Todd Presner that offers a brief introduction to Digital Humanities.

[DH Toychest: Guides and Introductions](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244275/Guides%20and%20Introductions): A set of resources curated by Alan Liu that includes information on academic blogging and tweeting, the job market for DH graduate students, and evaluating DH scholarship for promotion and tenure.

[The CUNY Digital Humanities Resource Guide](http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/The_CUNY_Digital_Humanities_Resource_Guide): A collaboratively produced introduction to the field of DH as part of the CUNY Digital Humanities Initiative (DHI), a growing working group for applying digital technologies to research and pedagogy in the humanities.

[Gettying Started in Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/getting-started-in-digital-humanities-by-lisa-spiro/): A how-to guide by Lisa Spiro that offers step-by-step instructions on joining the DH field.

1.3 Tutorials

*You do not have to be a technical expert to do DAH work. However, a baseline understanding of popular tools and technologies can often prove very useful for determining your project's approach and methodology. The following resources offer tutorials on a wide range of tools to help you get your project done.*

[Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/): If your institution doesn’t subscribe to this library of videos, you’ll have to pay \$25–\$37.50 a month. But it may be worth it — this is my go-to way to learn a new skill. The list of topics is ridiculously comprehensive, and the quality of instruction and production is uniformly high (much better than you’ll get from YouTube videos). Some people find watching videos tedious as compared to jumping around in a book, but Lynda does do a nice job keying its transcripts to videos and breaking up videos into three- to five-minute chunks.

[Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/): A popular collection of tutorials aimed specifically at humanities scholars. That means the skills it teaches are things you’ll actually want to do, like scrape the web for research data and format it into tables.

[“How Did They Make That?”](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/): A guide to help DHers reverse-engineer digital projects to that they can re-create them on their own. See also the [video](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/).

[Digital Humanities Questions & Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/): A bulletin board where DHers new and expert can ask each other questions. Beginner questions are welcome. It is a friendly and helpful community.

[LibGuides Community](http://libguides.com/community.php): The downside of LibGuides, the reference guides your library probably uses, is that they can be difficult to navigate and appear overwhelming. The upside is that you can search all the tutorials and reference guides (all written by experts) at once from this site. While this resource is less well-known, it can be extremely useful. Try searching, for example, for “text analysis.”

[“Some Things I Hope You Will Find Useful Even if Statistics Isn’t Your Thing”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279236049_Some_Things_i_Hope_You_Will_Find_Useful_even_if_Statistics_Isn%27t_Your_Thing): An article by George L. Cowgill that may convince you that statistical analysis could benefit your project.

[Statistics for the Humanities](http://statisticsforhumanities.net/book/): Developed by [John Canning](http://johncanning.net/), this resources is for those that find that they need mathematical skills for the advanced study of other subjects, including humanities and social science subjects.

1.4 Tools

*These tool directories are a great place to start looking if you are unsure what is available to help you complete your project.*

[Digital Research Tools (DiRT) Directory](http://dirtdirectory.org/): This is the best and most comprehensive list of DH tools. Because it is well-known and supported within the DH community, it is generally up to date.

[DH Toychest: Digital Humanities Resources for Project Building](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244243/FrontPage):
An excellent list that includes the tools, tutorials, and resources that Alan Liu uses in his DH courses at UC Santa Barbara.

1.5 Projects

*While the other chapters will offer projects more specific to the chapter topic, here is a list of Museum Digital Projects that are good to know for anyone getting to know the field of Digital Art History. Also, see the project lists compiled by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University: [Art History Collections (Highlights)](http://arthistory2014.doingdh.org/art-history-collections-highlights/) and [Digital Art History Web Highlights](http://arthistory2014.doingdh.org/digital-art-history-web-highlights/).*
