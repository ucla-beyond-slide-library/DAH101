5.3 Tutorials

[SketchUp Basic Contents
Tutorial](http://storage.googleapis.com/support-kmsprod/SNP_2600710_en_v0):
This guide covers the numerous 3D design and SketchUp concepts found
within the product and in the user community including: designing in
SketchUp, drawing quickly, viewing models in 3 dimensions, adding detail
to your model, presenting your model, modeling terrain and organic
shapes.  This section was primarily written for users who are new to 3D
modeling or SketchUp.  This section does not cover how to do something
in SketchUp, but covers important concepts necessary to model in 3D.

[SketchUp
Instructions](http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Sketchup%20basics.pdf):
This documentation is a step by step walkthrough with screenshots of how
to build a 3D object using SketchUp. Specifically geared to creating
architectural structures, this tutorial is a great orientation to the
key elements used in creating 3D models.

to use Vectorworks to design, communicate, and document the ideas that
you are passionate about. Click on the play button above to view the
introduction video.

5.4 Tools

*Building a 3D model is time-consuming. UCLA’s own* *[Lisa
Snyder](https://idre.ucla.edu/people/profiles/lisa-snyder) has spent her
career building a* *[model of the 1893 Chicago World’s
Fair](http://www.ust.ucla.edu/ustweb/Projects/columbian_expo.htm). (It
is a really great model.) However, there are a few tools with lower
barriers to entry.*

[SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/): SketchUp is the generally
recognized starter-kit for building a 3D model. It’s relatively easy to
use, but we find that people are often surprised by how long it takes to
build something with it. However, its
[documentation](http://www.sketchup.com/learn) is quite good.

[123D Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch): With SketchUp, you draw a
model yourself. With 123D catch, you build a model from photographs
using a process called photogrammetry. It has an app that you install on
your phone, and once you’ve taken many shots of the object you want to
capture, 123D Catch will stitch those photos together to make a 3D
object. The results are pretty impressive.
[Example](http://www.123dapp.com/Catch/Canopic-jar-captured-by-Bradford-Lowery-cleaned-up/2553088)
(click on “3D View”).

[3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/index.html): Someone
might have already made a 3D model for you! 3D Warehouse is a collection
of 3D models, some of them quite elaborate, like [this
one](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=71187c14aab1b33bdc0d3b8ac51c2a32)
of the Fisher Library at Penn.

[VSim](https://idre.ucla.edu/gis-visualization/vsim): We love VSim, AKA
“PowerPoint for 3D models.” We’re biased because it was developed by our
own [Lisa Snyder](https://idre.ucla.edu/people/profiles/lisa-snyder),
but it really does solve some problems with 3D models. A 3D model on its
own can be baffling to a viewer. And, especially when re-creating a
historical artifact, the modeler needs to convey to her viewers why she
made the decisions she did about its representation. VSim allows you to
take the viewer on a guided tour of a 3D model. Even better, sources and
documentation pop up in context as you move around the model, helping
you to understand, for example, why Lisa made the [Transportation
building](http://www.ust.ucla.edu/ustweb/Projects/Columbian_Expo/Trans4_612.htm)
that particular shade of red.
[Here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYYtDTucKL8&feature=youtu.be) a
tour of VSim’s key features.

[PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan): Agisoft PhotoScan
is a stand-alone software product that performs photogrammetric
processing of digital images and generates 3D spatial data to be used in
GIS applications, cultural heritage documentation, and visual effects
production as well as for indirect measurements of objects of various
scales.

[Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/): Vectorworks CAD software is
a line of industry-specific 2D/3D and BIM solutions that allow designers
to advance their ideas from concept through completion.

[Creator](http://www.presagis.com/products_services/products/modeling-simulation/content_creation/creator/):
Presagis Creator is the original software for creating optimized 3D
models for real-time simulation.  Designed specifically for simulation
applications, Creator allows content developers to work natively with
OpenFlight data to output highly optimized models with advanced surface
materials and multiple levels-of-detail. And, because of its streamlined
modeling process, Creator helps content developers meet expectations on
schedule.

[3ds Max](http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview): The 3D
software for modeling, animation, and rendering that allows you to
create massive worlds in games and stunning scenes for design
visualization.

[Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview): Another software
for 3D animation, modeling, simulation, and rendering software, Maya
helps artists tell their story with one fast, creative toolset.

[City Engine](http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine): Esri CityEngine
improves urban planning, architecture, and design. Use its 3D
visualization power to see the relationships of projects, assess their
feasibility, and plan their implementation.

[Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html): Google
Earth lets you fly anywhere on Earth to view satellite imagery, terrain,
3D buildings, from galaxies in outer space to the canyons of the ocean.
You can explore rich geographical content, save your toured places, and
