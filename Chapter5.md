[SketchUp Basic Contents Tutorial](http://storage.googleapis.com/support-kmsprod/SNP_2600710_en_v0): This guide covers the numerous 3D design and SketchUp concepts found within the product and in the user community including: designing in SketchUp, drawing quickly, viewing models in 3 dimensions, adding detail to your model, presenting your model, modeling terrain and organic shapes.  This section was primarily written for users who are new to 3D modeling or SketchUp.  This section does not cover how to do something in SketchUp, but covers important concepts necessary to model in 3D.

[SketchUp Instructions](http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Sketchup%20basics.pdf): This documentation is a step by step walkthrough with screenshots of how to build a 3D object using SketchUp. Specifically geared to creating architectural structures, this tutorial is a great orientation to the key elements used in creating 3D models.

<a name="tools">**5.4 Tools**</a>

*Building a 3D model is time-consuming. UCLA’s own [Lisa Snyder](https://idre.ucla.edu/people/profiles/lisa-snyder) has spent her career building a [model of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair](http://www.ust.ucla.edu/ustweb/Projects/columbian_expo.htm). However, there are a few tools with lower barriers to entry.*

[SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/): SketchUp is the generally recognized starter-kit for building a 3D model. It is relatively easy to use, but it takes a significant amount of time to
build something with it. However, its [documentation](http://www.sketchup.com/learn) is quite good.

[123D Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch): With SketchUp, you draw a model yourself. With 123D catch, you build a model from photographs using a process called photogrammetry. It has an app that you install on
your phone, and once you have taken many shots of the object you want to capture, 123D Catch will stitch those photos together to make a 3D object. The results are pretty impressive.
[Example](http://www.123dapp.com/Catch/Canopic-jar-captured-by-Bradford-Lowery-cleaned-up/2553088) (click on “3D View”).

[3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/index.html): Someone might have already made a 3D model for you! 3D Warehouse is a collection of 3D models, some of them quite elaborate, like [this one](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=71187c14aab1b33bdc0d3b8ac51c2a32) of the Fisher Library at Penn.

[VSim](https://idre.ucla.edu/gis-visualization/vsim): We love VSim, AKA “PowerPoint for 3D models.” Developed by [Lisa Snyder](https://idre.ucla.edu/people/profiles/lisa-snyder), it solves many common problems with 3D models. A 3D model on its own can be baffling to a viewer. And, especially when re-creating a historical artifact, the modeler needs to convey to her viewers why she made the decisions she did about its representation. VSim allows you to take the viewer on a guided tour of a 3D model. Even better, sources and documentation pop up in context as you move around the model, helping you to understand, for example, why Lisa made the [Transportation building](http://www.ust.ucla.edu/ustweb/Projects/Columbian_Expo/Trans4_612.htm) that particular shade of red. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYYtDTucKL8&feature=youtu.be) is a tour of VSim’s key features.

[PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan): Agisoft PhotoScan is a stand-alone software product that performs photogrammetric processing of digital images and generates 3D spatial data to be used in GIS applications, cultural heritage documentation, and visual effects production, as well as for indirect measurements of objects of various scales.

[Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/): Vectorworks CAD software is a line of industry-specific 2D/3D and BIM solutions that allow designers to advance their ideas from concept through completion.

[Creator](http://www.presagis.com/products_services/products/modeling-simulation/content_creation/creator/): Presagis Creator is the original software for creating optimized 3D models for real-time simulation.  Designed specifically for simulation applications, Creator allows content developers to work natively with OpenFlight data to output highly optimized models with advanced surface materials and multiple levels-of-detail. And, because of its streamlined modeling process, Creator helps content developers meet expectations on schedule.

[3ds Max](http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview): The 3D software for modeling, animation, and rendering that allows you to create massive worlds in games and stunning scenes for design
visualization.

[Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview): Another software for 3D animation, modeling, simulation, and rendering software, Maya helps artists tell their story with one fast, creative toolset.

[City Engine](http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine): Esri CityEngine improves urban planning, architecture, and design. Use its 3D visualization power to see the relationships of projects, assess their feasibility, and plan their implementation.

[Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html): Google Earth lets you fly anywhere on Earth to view satellite imagery, terrain, 3D buildings, from galaxies in outer space to the canyons of the ocean. You can explore rich geographical content, save your toured places, and share with others in this free desktop and mobile application.
