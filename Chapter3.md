title: 3. Information Visualization
---
<a name="top">*“Data visualization” covers all kinds of visualizations. This chapter serves as an introduction to visualizing data, with all of the benefits and drawbacks of turning information into graphics, both practically and intellectually. While mapping is a kind of visualization as well, the next chapter is specifically dedicated to geospatial data.*</a>

<a name="tutorials">**3.3 Tutorials**</a>

[Make a Pivot Table with Excel](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/make-a-pivot-table-with-excel/): A pivot table summarizes data values.

[Google Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232): A great starting point for creating data visualizations, especially for simpler charts, like pie charts and bar charts. You can’t do a ton of customization, but you can produce results with just a few clicks. [Here’s a basic tutorial.](http://miriamposner.com/blog/google-fusion-table-basics-with-ius-cushman-collection/)

[Tableau](http://get.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software.html?cid=701600000005cS4&ls=Paid%20Search&lsd=Google%20AdWords%20-%20Tableau%20-%20Free%20Trial&adgroup=Tableau%20-%20Exact&kw=tableau&adused=75054289935&distribution=search&gclid=Cj0KEQjw75yxBRD78uqEnuG-5vcBEiQAQbaxSJtqA3asFnYSUn9PFPAkuvKKootDA8qJJrkmmmfMt5saAtki8P8HAQ): Has a lot of advanced features and documentation. If you want to install it on your own laptop, choose [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/). This tool can be a little overwhelming at first, but Lynda.com has video tutorials; you might start with “Up and Running with Tableau.”

[*Visualize This* and *Data Points*, by Nathan Yau](http://www.amazon.com/Nathan-Yau/e/B004S83IUE): These books are a mix of step-by-step instructions and more general insights on dataviz.

[Creating a Network Graph with Gephi](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/creating-a-network-graph-with-gephi/): Gephi is a powerful tool for network analysis, but it can be intimidating. It has a lot of tools for statistical analysis of network data — most of which you won’t be using at this stage of your work. This tutorial will walk you through creating a basic network visualization.

[Nodes Lists and Edge Lists](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/node-lists-and-edge-lists/): To build a network diagram, you need a list of nodes (the individual actors) and a list of edges (the relationships between the actors).

<a name="tools">**3.4 Tools**</a>

*General*

Excel: You can get pretty far with Excel’s built-in charts and graphs. They are not very fancy, but they are quite functional.

[RAW](http://raw.densitydesign.org/): An open web application to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [D3.js library](http://d3js.org/) through a simple interface. You can make some really cool graphs and charts with [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/), and it is easy to embed them in a website.

[Palladio](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/): A web-based platform for the visualization of complex, multi-dimensional data. As with ManyEyes, you can upload a dataset and visualize it in a number of different ways. But the kinds of visualizations you can do are somewhat more advanced: you can combine maps and timelines, filter your data, make bimodal network graphs (ManyEyes only lets you do 1-mode), create relationships among tables, and download your data model. This may be the tool to try if you find that ManyEyes can’t quite handle what you want. Palladio is still new, so the documentation isn’t as robust as one might like, but [this intro video](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/lab-notebook/palladio/2014/06/20/full-video-tutorial/) is very helpful. However, Palladio is designed for the exploration (not necessarily the presentation) of humanities data. So while you can produce some impressive visualizations, you cannot really embed them. You can take
screenshots, though. [Example](http://ricedh.github.io/01-palladio.html)[.](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/)

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/): D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.

[Viewshare](http://viewshare.org/): A free platform for generating and customizing views (interactive maps, timelines, facets, tag clouds) that allow users to experience your digital collections. Developed at the Library of Congress, ViewShare is a tool that allows you to visualize a spreadsheet of data in many different ways, including as a map. Its standout feature, is its faceted browsing capability. You can drill down in your data, much the way you drill down from “shoes” to “women’s shoes” to “pumps” on Amazon.] [Example](http://viewshare.org/views/drevans/swag-diplomacy-black-travel-memoirs/).

[Tableau](http://www.tableausoftware.com/): Open data and explore it with Tableau Desktop Public Edition. Drag and drop to create stunning visualizations with ease.

[Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/): A newer, web-based dataviz tool that has a lot of cool features, and it is easy to get started with it. Plot.ly is free for unlimited public charts. Charts can be easily embedded on a website from this platform.

*Image Analysis Tools*

*Image analysis, particularly computerized image recognition, is still fairly crude, but a number of tools do allow you to work with images as data.*

[Image Plot, Image Montage, Image Slice, and Visual Sense](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/software-for-digital-humanities.html): Created by the Lev Manovich-led Software Studies Initiative, these tools allow you to analyze many images at once.
[ImagePlot](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html) is free software tool that visualizes collections of images and video of any size. It is implemented as a macro which works with the open source
image processing program [ImageJ](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)[.](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html). Image Plot arranges images on axes according to user-defined parameters, Image Montage arrays tiny thumbnails in a grid, Image Slice provides a “slice” view of an image collection, and Visual Sense is an environment for exploring images as plots, bar graphs, and arrays. The Software Studies Initiative has provided fairly robust documentation. See how Manovich and his team have used these tools in the [Projects](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/research_14.html) section of the Software Studies Initiative’s site.

[Image Quilts](http://imagequilts.com/): The brainchild of Edward Tufte, Image Quilts is a simple plugin for the Chrome browser that arrays all the images on a given webpage in a grid. Use it with, for example, a Google Image search for “happiness” to see some of the most popular representations of the concept in a neat grid. Great for teaching.

[TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/): Feed TinEye an image and it will scour the web for visually similar images.
