***(Chapter 3) Information Visualization***

*“Data visualization” is hopelessly imprecise, since there are so many
different kinds of visualizations and mapping, of course, is a kind of
visualization, too. But here are some resources we turn to when we want
to start to make visual sense of a lot of data.*

3.3 Tutorials

[Make a Pivot Table with
Excel](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/make-a-pivot-table-with-excel/):
A pivot table summarizes data values.

[Google Fusion
Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232): A great
starting point for creating data visualizations, especially for simpler
charts, like pie charts and bar charts. You can’t do a ton of
customization, but you can produce results with just a few clicks.
[Here’s a basic
tutorial.](http://miriamposner.com/blog/google-fusion-table-basics-with-ius-cushman-collection/)

[Tableau](http://get.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software.html?cid=701600000005cS4&ls=Paid%20Search&lsd=Google%20AdWords%20-%20Tableau%20-%20Free%20Trial&adgroup=Tableau%20-%20Exact&kw=tableau&adused=75054289935&distribution=search&gclid=Cj0KEQjw75yxBRD78uqEnuG-5vcBEiQAQbaxSJtqA3asFnYSUn9PFPAkuvKKootDA8qJJrkmmmfMt5saAtki8P8HAQ):
Has a lot of advanced features and documentation. If you want to install
it on your own laptop, choose [Tableau
Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/). This tool can be a little
overwhelming at first, but Lynda.com has video tutorials; you might
start with “Up and Running with Tableau.”

[*Visualize This* and *Data Points*, both by Nathan
Yau](http://www.amazon.com/Nathan-Yau/e/B004S83IUE): These books are a
really nice mix of step-by-step instructions and more general insights
on dataviz.

[Creating a Network Graph with
Gephi](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/creating-a-network-graph-with-gephi/):
Gephi is a powerful tool for network analysis, but it can be
intimidating. It has a lot of tools for statistical analysis of network
data — most of which you won’t be using at this stage of your work. This
tutorial will walk you through creating a basic network visualization.

[Nodes Lists and Edge
Lists](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/node-lists-and-edge-lists/):
To build a network diagram, you need a list of nodes (the individual
actors) and a list of edges (the relationships between the actors).

3.4 Tools

*General*

Excel: You can get pretty far with Excel’s built-in charts and graphs.
They often don’t look wonderful, but if they work, they work!

[RAW: An open web application to create custom vector-based
visualizations on top of the amazing](http://raw.densitydesign.org/)
[D3.js library](http://d3js.org/) [through a simple interface. You can
make some really cool graphs and charts
with](http://raw.densitydesign.org/)
[RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/)[, and it’s easy to embed them
on a website.](http://raw.densitydesign.org/)

[Palladio: A web-based platform for the visualization of complex,
multi-dimensional data. As with ManyEyes, you can upload a dataset and
visualize it in a number of different ways. But the kinds of
visualizations you can do are somewhat more advanced: you can combine
maps and timelines, filter your data, make bimodal network graphs
(ManyEyes only lets you do 1-mode), create relationships among tables,
and download your data model. This may be the tool to try if you find
that ManyEyes can’t quite handle what you want. Palladio is still new,
so the documentation isn’t as robust as one might like,
but](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/) [this intro
video](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/lab-notebook/palladio/2014/06/20/full-video-tutorial/)
[is very helpful.](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/) [However,
Palladio is designed for the exploration (not necessarily the
presentation) of humanities data. So while you can produce some
impressive visualizations, you can’t really embed them. You can take
screenshots, though.
Example](http://ricedh.github.io/01-palladio.html)[.](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/)

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/): D3.js is a JavaScript library for
manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life
using HTML, SVG, and CSS.

[Viewshare: A free platform for generating and customizing views
(interactive maps, timelines, facets, tag clouds) that allow users to
experience your digital collections. Developed at the Library of
Congress, ViewShare is a tool that allows you to visualize a spreadsheet
of data in many different ways, including as a map. Its standout
feature, is its faceted browsing capability. You can drill down in your
data, much the way you drill down from “shoes” to “women’s shoes” to
“pumps” on Amazon.](http://viewshare.org/)
[Example](http://viewshare.org/views/drevans/swag-diplomacy-black-travel-memoirs/)[.](http://viewshare.org/)

[Tableau: Open data and explore it with Tableau Desktop Public Edition.
Drag & Drop. Create stunning visualizations with
ease](http://www.tableausoftware.com/).

[Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/): A newer, web-based dataviz tool that has a
lot of cool features, and it’s pretty easy to get started with it. It’s
a little bit hard to tell from the website, but Plot.ly is free for
unlimited public charts. Plus, you can easily embed them on a website.

*Image Analysis Tools*

*Image analysis, particularly computerized image recognition, is still
fairly crude, but a number of tools do allow you to work with images as
data.*

[Image Plot, Image Montage, Image Slice, and Visual
Sense](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/software-for-digital-humanities.html):
 Created by the Lev Manovich-led Software Studies Initiative, these
tools allow you to analyze many images at once.
[*ImagePlot*](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html) is [free
software tool that visualizes collections of images and video of any
size. It is implemented as a macro which works with the open source
image processing
program](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html)
[ImageJ](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)[.](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html)
Image Plot arranges images on axes according to user-defined parameters,
Image Montage arrays tiny thumbnails in a grid, Image Slice provides a
“slice” view of an image collection, and Visual Sense is an environment
for exploring images as plots, bar graphs, and arrays. The Software
Studies Initiative has provided fairly robust documentation. See how
Manovich and his team have used these tools in the
[Projects](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/research_14.html) section of
the Software Studies Initiative’s site.

[Image Quilts](http://imagequilts.com/): The brainchild of Edward Tufte,
Image Quilts is a simple plugin for the Chrome browser that arrays all
the images on a given webpage in a grid. Use it with, for example, a
Google Image search for “happiness” to see some of the most popular
representations of the concept in a neat grid. Great for teaching.

[TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/): Feed TinEye an image and it will
scour the web for visually similar images.
