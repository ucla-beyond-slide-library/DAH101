6.3 Tutorials

[HTML and CSS
Basics](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/html-css/):
Resources to learn the basics of writing of code.

6.4 Tools

[Timemapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/): Create elegant timelines
and maps in seconds that can be customized and embedded into a webpage.
This is an easy and open-source tool, which uses a slide show feature to
help users navigate through time and space.

[Timeline.js: The slideshow feature from Timemapper, comes from this
tool. Individual slides get added to a timeline which can be navigated
like a slideshow or scrolled through to jump to a particular point in
time.](http://timeline.knightlab.com/)

[Neatline](http://neatline.org/): Designed to work with the exhibit
platform Omeka (see below), Neatline is best for smaller mapping
projects for which visual detail and the element of time is important.
You can draw polygons on the map and use Neatline’s timeline feature to
walk users through changes over time. (You can also use Neatline to
annotate an image.) One thing that’s distinctive about Neatline is that
every point on your map can be an item from your Omeka collection. So,
for example, if you have an Omeka collection that contains works of art,
you can automatically plot each one, metadata and all, on your Neatline
map. Neatline’s [documentation](http://docs.neatline.org/) is the best
source of information about it.
[Example](http://ibnjubayr.lib.virginia.edu/view-exhibits).

[MyHistro](http://www.myhistro.com/): Watch and read thousands of
fascinating timelines, or create your own. Complete with text, video and
pictures to create a dynamic timeline mashup. Using myHistro, you can
combine maps and timelines seamlessly into one great presentation,
convert any public timeline into a personal pdf file, or export it into
Google Earth format for offline storage. All completed timelines can be
embedded into your blog and websites for maximum exposure
