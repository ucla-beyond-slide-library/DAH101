While the previous chapters have offered a solid foundation, this final chapter offers a few more advanced techniques.  It also contains pedagogical content to help teach about DH tools and methodologies.*</a>

<a name="tutorials">**6.3 Tutorials**</a>

[HTML and CSS Basics](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/tutorials-and-resources/html-css/): Resources to learn the basics of writing of code.

<a name="tools">**6.4 Tools**</a>

[Timemapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/): Create elegant timelines and maps in seconds that can be customized and embedded into a webpage. This is an easy and open-source tool, which uses a slide show feature to help users navigate through time and space.

[Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com/): The slideshow feature from Timemapper, comes from this tool. Individual slides get added to a timeline which can be navigated like a slideshow or scrolled through to jump to a particular point in time.

[Neatline](http://neatline.org/): Designed to work with the exhibit platform Omeka (see below), Neatline is best for smaller mapping projects for which visual detail and the element of time is important. You can draw polygons on the map and use Neatline’s timeline feature to walk users through changes over time. (You can also use Neatline to annotate an image.) One thing that’s distinctive about Neatline is that every point on your map can be an item from your Omeka collection. So, for example, if you have an Omeka collection that contains works of art, you can automatically plot each one, metadata and all, on your Neatline map. Neatline’s [documentation](http://docs.neatline.org/) is the best
source of information about it. [Example](http://ibnjubayr.lib.virginia.edu/view-exhibits).

[MyHistro](http://www.myhistro.com/): Watch and read thousands of fascinating timelines, or create your own. Complete with text, video and pictures to create a dynamic timeline mashup. Using myHistro, you can combine maps and timelines seamlessly into one great presentation, convert any public timeline into a personal pdf file, or export it into Google Earth format for offline storage. All completed timelines can be embedded into your blog and websites for maximum exposure
